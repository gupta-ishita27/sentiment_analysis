"  It is not very sterdy. Won't help if you are planning to use it for longer time everyday. Bears only light weight. Colour is good, exactly as shown in the picture. Length, wideness is as mentioned in the description.",3.0 out of 5 stars
  Misleading images and description .  The actual table dimensions { 24×16x 11) do not match the description and images shown (27.6x18.9×11.1).,1.0 out of 5 stars
  Very light weighted. Honestly the glass keeping circle in the table is not of much use. So you can choose the one without it. Best for children an well as it’s very light weighted. Good looking table. Worth buying.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"  As this is very lightweight, it cannot balance itself well.  The design also doesn't help as the table is shaky and its a risk to put the laptop on it unattended.",2.0 out of 5 stars
  Nice procduct  and of good quality,5.0 out of 5 stars
  The table is really good. Only if the cup holder and the phone holder did not come off. These are not stuck to the table and come off every time you carry it. Otherwise very satisfied with the product.,4.0 out of 5 stars
  Looks really good in the picture. In reality it looks like cheap MDF stuff. Quality is strictly ok. Over priced.,3.0 out of 5 stars

"  The product is very light weight so I doubt its durability and sturdiness. The legs are made of steel but the attachment that hold it with the table is made up of plastic. They should have added adhesive to its cup and tab holder, they come out very easily, it was unexpected. The ply board is half a inch thick. Overall it has a premium outlook. caution: it is not for kids.",3.8 out of 5 stars
"  At first i am hesitate to buy it because there was no ratings and review for this. I thought to place order for this because this got the least price when compared to other tables with cup holder that is 699rs, after receiving the order everything is okay,build quality is good and cup holder is on the right hand side. Blindly Go for it if it is available for less than 700rs",4.0 out of 5 stars

  The product just arrived today and after the initial usage I found that the dimensions mentioned in the website are different from the dimensions of the product arrived. In the website it's 27.6 x 18.9 x 11.1 And actual is 23.5 x 15.5 x 9. Either correct the dimensions on the website or deliver the same product as mentioned. A little disappointed.,1.0 out of 5 stars
  I bought this product couple of weeks back from Amazon. The delivery was on time considering the lockdown period however the product is not worth its price. The table legs are very shaky and with a little movement it easily falls off. I was looking for better sturdiness at the price. Only good feature about this one is its mobile/tablet holder.,3.0 out of 5 stars
High risk to laptop /tablet/ phone due to its sturdiness.,2.0 out of 5 stars
"  Good laptop bed-table for the price. I bought two of these but from different sellers. This one was 50/- cheaper and the plastic inserts are of same colour. These tables are never absolutely stable by design (I would have given 5 stars otherwise). So nothing wrong in that. Good quality. Packaging was done very well. I already have a good quality wooden table for which I paid double. But I like this one as this one is bit taller and I can stretch my legs below the table more comfortably. Well it's for my daughter, so pink is what she chose! The grip works better than the wooden one. Width of this one is more. It's lighter in weight to carry more comfortably. Feels sturdy enough. Go for it!",5.0 out of 5 stars

"Very disappointed with this purchase! It's not even been a month and as you can see from the picture I have attached, the leg of the table has broken. Also the tab holder and cup holder have also become loose and come out. This is a serious concern on quality of the products that you are selling. I have crossed my exchange window but it would be great if you can still provide me a replacement for this product at the earliest.",3.0 out of 5 stars
